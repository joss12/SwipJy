# ⚡️ Swipjy

> A minimal, lightning-fast backend framework built with pure Node.js — no bloat, no nonsense, just clean control.

Swipjy is a raw yet powerful backend framework crafted for developers who love simplicity, speed, and structure. No dependencies, no abstraction hell — just pure Node.js, your rules.

Think of it as:

⚡ Fast like Express, but sharper
